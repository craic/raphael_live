Raphaël Live

(Last updated 2010-03-11)

This is a web page that lets you explore and experiment with the Raphaël JavaScript Library
for creating Vector Graphics in the browser.

Download the code, or git clone it, point your browser at the raphael_live.html page and have at it!

Git clone it with either of these links 
git clone git@github.com:craic/raphael_live.git
git clone http://github.com/craic/raphael_live.git
(The 'git@' version may fail if you are behind a restrictive firewall)

Raphaël was created by Dmitry Baranovskiy and can be found at http://raphaeljs.org.

This page was created by Robert Jones at Craic Computing LLC (http://craic.com).

The page uses jQuery (http://jquery.com) and CodeMirror (http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror/)

The jQuery and Raphaël libraries are already loaded in the page and you access the
Canvas through the variable 'paper'.

This code is freely distributed under the terms of the MIT license (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
	
The code is available on github at http://github.com/craic/raphael_live. I hope to
add and extend the examples over time so check back every so often.

A live version of the page is available at:
